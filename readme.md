# Is it Lit?

React native playground. Just inspired by a simple app 'stashd' tried to clone it in react-native. In-short just a tinder for clothes.

### How to use

Assuming you have react native installed [guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)  
Just go into the root of this project and run

```
 npm i
 react-native run-ios
```  

You will have to be on OSX.  
No Android
